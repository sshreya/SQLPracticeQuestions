CREATE TABLE city_population (
    state VARCHAR(50),
    city VARCHAR(50),
    population INT
);
INSERT INTO city_population (state, city, population) VALUES ('haryana', 'ambala', 100);
INSERT INTO city_population (state, city, population) VALUES ('haryana', 'panipat', 200);
INSERT INTO city_population (state, city, population) VALUES ('haryana', 'gurgaon', 300);
INSERT INTO city_population (state, city, population) VALUES ('punjab', 'amritsar', 150);

Solution:
WITH max_pop AS(
SELECT 
	state,
	city AS most_populated_city
FROM 
	city_population 
WHERE 
	(state, population) IN (SELECT state, max(population) FROM city_population GROUP BY state)
)
,min_pop AS(
SELECT 
	state,
	city AS least_populated_city
FROM 
	city_population 
WHERE 
	(state, population) IN (SELECT state, min(population) FROM city_population GROUP BY state)
)
SELECT 
	a.*,
	b.least_populated_city
FROM 
	max_pop a 
JOIN 
	min_pop b 
ON a.state = b.state
;
